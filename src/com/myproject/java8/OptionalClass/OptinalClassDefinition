Optional Class
Java 8 has introduced a new class Optional in java.util package.
                It is used to represent a value is present or absent

Optional is intended to provide a limited mechanism for library method
return types where there needed to be a clear way to represent â€œno result,"
and using null for such was overwhelmingly likely to cause errors

Advantages of Java 8 Optional:
    Null checks are not required.
    No more NullPointerException at run-time.
    We can develop clean and neat APIs.
    No more Boiler plate code

Misuse of Optionals
Optional is not meant to be used in these contexts, as it won't buy us anything:

in the domain model layer (not serializable)
in DTOs (same reason)
in input parameters of methods
in constructor parameters
